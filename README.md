# a really simple filename change tool  
In configs.conf, change folderPath to your own path.  
Execute changefilename.exe, and a .txt file with file name will be generated. Change it and save.  
Please note that this is my first attempt.  
Idea come from Simplest File Renamer, in future maybe a visual interface will be done
